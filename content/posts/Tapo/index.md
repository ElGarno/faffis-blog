# Introduction

In today's world, energy efficiency is more important than ever. With the rise of smart home devices, monitoring and managing energy consumption has become easier and more efficient. In this blog post, we will explore how to utilize Tapo devices for energy monitoring and prediction, leveraging Python, InfluxDB, and Grafana for visualization and alerts.

## Resources

To get started, you can use theÂ [Github Python API for Tapo](https://github.com/mihai-dinculescu/tapo). This API allows you to retrieve data from your Tapo devices using Python, making it a powerful tool for energy monitoring.

## Energy Monitoring

The core of our energy monitoring system is a Python script that runs in a Docker container on my Synology NAS. This script collects energy consumption data from various devices every 30 seconds and writes it into InfluxDB, a time-series database also hosted on the NAS in a Docker container.

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Docker Containers**: Both the Python script and InfluxDB run in separate Docker containers, ensuring a clean and isolated environment for each service.
2. **Data Collection**: The Python script communicates with the Tapo devices to fetch energy consumption data. This data is then timestamped and stored in InfluxDB for further analysis.
3. **Visualization**: To visualize the collected data, we use Grafana, which connects to InfluxDB and provides a user-friendly dashboard to monitor energy consumption trends over time.

## Other Use Cases

Beyond simple energy monitoring, the consumption data can be utilized for practical applications, such as sending alerts when appliances like the washing machine or dryer are ready. This is achieved through an over-threshold-under-threshold method:

1. **Threshold Detection**: When the energy consumption exceeds a predefined threshold, the system recognizes that the appliance is in operation (e.g., the washer is washing or the dryer is drying).
2. **Completion Detection**: If the energy consumption falls below a smaller threshold and remains there for 5 minutes after the device was turned on, the algorithm determines that the appliance has finished its cycle.
3. **Alert Notification**: Once the appliance is done, a notification is sent to both me and my wife via "Pushover," ensuring we are informed without having to check the devices manually.

## Conclusion

By integrating Tapo devices with Python, InfluxDB, and Grafana, we can create a robust energy monitoring and prediction system. This setup not only helps in tracking energy consumption but also enhances our daily lives by providing timely alerts for household appliances. As we continue to embrace smart technology, the potential for energy efficiency and automation is limitless.
