## Introduction

Synology NAS devices are not only excellent for backups and data storage but also serve as powerful web servers and platforms for running Docker containers. With the ability to operate 24/7, both your NAS and the Docker containers can remain consistently available. The vast array of available containers can make it challenging to choose the best ones for your needs. In this article, I will introduce you to the containers I use most frequently, including those for ad-blocking, creating a paperless office, managing home automation, and running custom Python code.

## My Top Containers

Here are my top picks for Docker containers that enhance the functionality of my NAS:

- **Home Assistant** (home automation)
- {{< figure src="/images/logos/portainer.png" alt="Portainer Logo" style="height: 1.2em; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" >}} **Portainer** (managing containers)
- **Pihole** (security and ad-blocker)
- **Twingate** (zero-trust network for remote access)
- **paperless_ngx** (for a paper-free office)
- **Grafana** (dashboarding)
- **Database** (PostgreSQL or InfluxDB for time-series data)
- **Custom Python Code** (packaging your own scripts)
- **n8n** (automation)

### Portainer

Portainer is an essential tool for managing your Docker containers. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can view every detail of your stacks and containers, access logs, and deploy new containers with ease.

### Pihole

Pihole acts as an ad-blocker for your network, allowing you to block unwanted advertisements and set up specific restrictions or rules for each device connected to your network. This enhances security and improves browsing experiences across all devices.

### Twingate

Twingate offers a zero-trust network solution, enabling secure remote access to your home network. With its mobile app, you can connect safely to your NAS from anywhere, ensuring that your data remains protected.

### paperless-ngx

The paperless-ngx container is perfect for creating a paper-free office. When used with a duplex scanner, it allows for automatic tag generation through plugins and OCR detection, enabling full-text scans and searches. This makes it an excellent solution for storing and managing documents on your NAS.

### Grafana

Grafana is a well-known dashboarding tool that helps visualize your databases. It offers a wide range of aggregation functionalities and is highly performant, making it ideal for monitoring and analyzing data.

### Database (PostgreSQL or InfluxDB)

Having a solid database like PostgreSQL or InfluxDB on your NAS is crucial for storing web content, sensor data, or other information. These databases provide reliable storage solutions for various applications.

### n8n

n8n is a popular automation tool that allows you to create and run workflows, including those that incorporate AI. It simplifies the process of automating tasks and integrating different services.

### Custom Containers

For those who want to run their own Python code, creating custom containers is a great option. This allows you to package your scripts and run them seamlessly on your NAS, providing flexibility and control over your applications.

## Conclusion

Utilizing Docker containers on your Synology NAS can significantly enhance its capabilities, transforming it into a versatile server for various applications. Whether you're looking to block ads, automate tasks, or manage your documents, the containers mentioned above can help you achieve a more efficient and organized digital environment.
